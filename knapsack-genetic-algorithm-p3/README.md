# Knapsack Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains the code for solving the Knapsack problem using a Genetic Algorithm.

## Project Description

The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where given a set of items with certain values and weights, the goal is to determine the most valuable combination of items to fit into a knapsack with a limited capacity. The Genetic Algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution.

The `knapsack_genetic_algorithm.py` file contains the main code for solving the Knapsack problem using a Genetic Algorithm. It includes the following steps:

1. Reading input: The code reads the capacity, values, and weights of the items from the `c.txt`, `v.txt`, and `w.txt` files, respectively. Make sure to update these files with the appropriate values before running the code.

2. Generating an initial population: The algorithm starts by generating an initial population of candidate solutions. Each solution represents a possible combination of items to be included in the knapsack.

3. Fitness calculation: The fitness of each candidate solution is calculated based on its value and weight. Solutions with weights exceeding the knapsack capacity are assigned a fitness value of 0.

4. Parent selection: The algorithm uses either Roulette-wheel Selection or K-Tournament Selection to select parent solutions for the crossover operation.

5. Crossover: The selected parent solutions undergo N-point crossover to create new offspring solutions. N-point crossover involves selecting multiple crossover points and exchanging genetic material between the parents to create new individuals.

6. Mutation: The offspring solutions may undergo mutation, where a random gene is altered, to introduce diversity into the population.

7. Survival selection: The new offspring solutions replace existing solutions in the population based on either age-based selection or fitness-based selection.

8. Elitism: If enabled, the best solution from the previous generation is preserved in the population to ensure the best solution found so far is not lost.

9. Termination condition: The algorithm continues these steps for a specified number of generations. The best solution found at the end of the iterations is considered the final solution.

10. Output: The final solution, including the best chromosome, weight, and value, is written to the `out.txt` file.

## Usage

To run the Knapsack Genetic Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies, NumPy and Matplotlib, by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Update the input files:
   - `c.txt` should contain the capacity of the knapsack.
   - `v.txt` should contain the values of the items.
   - `w.txt` should contain the weights of the items.

   Make sure the values and weights are listed in the same order.

4. Run the `knapsack_genetic_algorithm.py` script using Python:

   ```shell
   python knapsack_genetic_algorithm.py
   ```

5. The output, including the best chromosome, weight, and value, will be written to the `out.txt` file.

Feel free to customize the input files and explore the code to further understand the implementation of the Knapsack problem solution using a Genetic Algorithm.
