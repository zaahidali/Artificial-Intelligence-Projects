# CENG3511

Welcome to my personal **CENG3511** repository at [Mugla Sitki Kocman University](https://www.mu.edu.tr/). This repository contains a collection of projects that I developed for the **CENG3511** course. Each project focuses on a specific topic and includes implementations of various algorithms and programs.

## Projects

1. **Graph Search Algorithms**: This project implements graph search algorithms such as Uniform Cost Search, Depth First Search, and Breadth First Search. These algorithms are essential for traversing graphs and finding optimal paths.

2. **Constraint Solving Programs**: In this project, constraint satisfaction problems are solved using various techniques. It includes implementations of Kakuros and Futoshiki programs, which are puzzle games that require finding valid solutions while satisfying specific constraints.

3. **Knapsack Genetic Algorithm**: The Knapsack Genetic Algorithm project addresses the Knapsack problem, which involves selecting items to maximize the total value within a limited capacity. It utilizes genetic algorithms to optimize the item selection process.

4. **KNN Algorithm**: This project focuses on mobile price classification using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. By analyzing the features of mobile devices and comparing them to a training dataset, the KNN algorithm predicts the price range of a given mobile device.

5. **K-means Algorithm**: The K-means Algorithm project demonstrates the application of the K-means clustering algorithm. It groups a set of data points into K clusters based on their similarities, aiming to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. This algorithm is commonly used in data analysis and pattern recognition tasks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
